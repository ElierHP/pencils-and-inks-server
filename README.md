Pencils and Inks is an e-commerce website that I developed from scratch using React & Next js for the client side and Ruby on Rails for the server API. The website includes various features such as; products, users, filter settings, a review system with ratings, a shopping cart, and an admin panel for CRUD operations.

The project is currently live on the web at : [https://pencils-and-inks.netlify.app](https://pencils-and-inks.netlify.app/)

## Front End

The client side was built using React and the Next js framework. Styling was done with a CSS-in-JS approach using Emotion js.

The frontend codebase can be viewed on the github repo below. :arrow_down:
